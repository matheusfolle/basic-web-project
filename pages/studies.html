                <p>for a long time, I was buried under studies and goals, not realizing the deeper rhythm of what God was doing in my life. now, things are changing. in <strong>Deuteronomy 6:4-5</strong>, we find the foundation of Israel's faith:</p>
                <blockquote>“hear, oh Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one. love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.”</blockquote>
                <p>this verse, known as the <em>shema</em> (שְׁמַע), is not just a call to believe — it's a call to listen, obey, and live. it's a rhythm passed across generations. and what amazes me is how Jesus himself echoes it in <strong>Mark 12:28-34</strong>, when he says:</p>
                <blockquote>“the most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘hear, o israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one...’”</blockquote>
                <p>that moment links something ancient and something new. the hebrew word <strong>shema</strong> (שְׁמַע) means more than hearing — it means listening with action. in greek, Jesus uses <strong>akouo</strong> (ἀκούω), a word that only appears once in this exact moment. that small difference carries a weight: it's not just about sound, it's about attention, response, and transformation.</p>
                <p>I believe this same rhythm can echo through code, through design, through life... I no longer see my skills as separate from my purpose. ok, I want peace. a good home in a good neighborhood. I want stability. but I also want to build things that matter. I believe I can be part of something greater — to understand the world, speak its language, and use that awareness to improve people’s lives.</p>
                <p>thanks be to God — because now, I'm able to see things more deeply and I want to stay that way.</p>
